Esteemed data scientist and computer science student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, proficienct in several programming languages and technologies. Undergraduate research consisted of Markov Chains Analysis, Pulsar Search Collaborations, and Super Massive Binary Blackhole Simulations. My favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/). 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
